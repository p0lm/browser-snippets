# userscripts
A collection of javascript snippets for in the browser. 

## Usage
These snippets can be used in multiple ways. They are collected from writing userscripts (GreaseMonkey / ViolentMonkey) for my browser over the years. As the browser keeps on growing as a platform, extensibility and hacking becomes more of a necessisity every day. Luckily, Chrome now supports native userscripts, and Firefox has had it's Scratchpad for ages.
